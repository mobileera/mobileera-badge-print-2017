Very precise definition, but might be confusing at first. What 'light-weight thread' means? How does suspension work?

Although you write JavaScript with React Native, the components you define will end up rendering as native widgets on the respective platforms. Hence, React Native allows you to write truly native applications, with the ease and speed of development and debugging using JavaScript.",
